# Connect Redux to React
FreecodeCamp - Front End Libraries Certification - React and Redux: Connect Redux to React


---


### What is asked

The code editor has the mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps() functions and a new React component called Presentational. Connect this component to Redux with the connect method from the ReactRedux global object, and call it immediately on the Presentational component. Assign the result to a new const called ConnectedComponent that represents the connected component. That's it, now you're connected to Redux! Try changing either of connect's arguments to null and observe the test results.


#### Script to complete

```javascript  
  
const addMessage = (message) => {
  return {
    type: 'ADD',
    message: message
  }
};

const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return {
    messages: state
  }
};

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    submitNewMessage: (message) => {
      dispatch(addMessage(message));
    }
  }
};

class Presentational extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return <h3>This is a Presentational Component</h3>
  }
};

const connect = ReactRedux.connect;
// Change code below this line
  

```

### What I answered

```javascript  
  
const addMessage = (message) => {
  return {
    type: 'ADD',
    message: message
  }
};

const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return {
    messages: state
  }
};

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    submitNewMessage: (message) => {
      dispatch(addMessage(message));
    }
  }
};

class Presentational extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return <h3>This is a Presentational Component</h3>
  }
};

const connect = ReactRedux.connect;
// Change code below this line
const ConnectedComponent = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Presentational)
  

```

### Tests passed

✓ The Presentational component should render.

✓ The Presentational component should receive a prop messages via connect.

✓ The Presentational component should receive a prop submitNewMessage via connect.
