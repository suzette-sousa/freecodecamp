# Use const for Action Types
FreecodeCamp - Front End Libraries Certification - Redux: Use const for Action Types


---


### What is asked

There are counterReducer() and authReducer() functions provided in the code editor, along with a Redux store. Finish writing the rootReducer() function using the Redux.combineReducers() method. Assign counterReducer to a key called count and authReducer to a key called auth.

#### Script to complete

```javascript  
  
const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
const DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';

const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case INCREMENT:
      return state + 1;
    case DECREMENT:
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const LOGIN = 'LOGIN';
const LOGOUT = 'LOGOUT';

const authReducer = (state = {authenticated: false}, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case LOGIN:
      return {
        authenticated: true
      }
    case LOGOUT:
      return {
        authenticated: false
      }
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const rootReducer = // Define the root reducer here

const store = Redux.createStore(rootReducer);
  

```

### What I answered

```javascript  
  
const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
const DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';

const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case INCREMENT:
      return state + 1;
    case DECREMENT:
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const LOGIN = 'LOGIN';
const LOGOUT = 'LOGOUT';

const authReducer = (state = {authenticated: false}, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case LOGIN:
      return {
        authenticated: true
      }
    case LOGOUT:
      return {
        authenticated: false
      }
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const rootReducer = Redux.combineReducers({
  count: counterReducer,
  auth: authReducer
});

const store = Redux.createStore(rootReducer);
  

```

### Tests passed

✓ The counterReducer should increment and decrement the state.

✓ The authReducer should toggle the state of authenticated between true and false.

✓ The store state should have two keys: count, which holds a number, and auth, which holds an object. The auth object should have a property of authenticated, which holds a boolean.

✓ The rootReducer should be a function that combines the counterReducer and the authReducer.
